I am thrilled to announce the completion and deployment of my latest project - a USD/EGP time series forecasting app!
Using Python, I built a model to predict the USD/EGP exchange rate based on historical data That I scrapped from www.investing.com The model was trained using the Facebook Prophet Model & ARIMA Model , which made the process incredibly easy and straightforward.

I also used Flask to create a simple web interface that allows users to input a date range and view the predicted exchange rates for that period.
To deploy the app, I containerized it using Docker and deployed it to AWS ECS (but it costs me money ðŸ˜‚ ) so I deployed it to a free server at Render.com.
I also utilized Render CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment to ensure that the app is always up-to-date and functioning properly.
I'm really proud of how this project turned out and excited to share it with others. If you're interested in checking it out, you can find it at
